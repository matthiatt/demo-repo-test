            I am 27, recently just moved back to the Chicagoland area from Bloomington, Illinois; I was there for 8 years becuase of school. No, I do not have a doctorate degree! I have a degree in English Education and Political Science.

            I worked in I.T for a bit, but more on the e-commerce side of the I.T world. So I mainly focused on B2B, SEO/SEM, and database problems.
